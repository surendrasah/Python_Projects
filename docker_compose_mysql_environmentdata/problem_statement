Data Engineering Challenge
1. The Challenge
Demonstrate your data engineering skills:
Set up a SQL database to be run inside a docker container, store the attached dataset in a
normalized (3rd normal form (3NF)) way in the database. BONUS: While you do this, establish
database versioning and make it reproducible, such that the database with final schema and
populated data can be reproduced with a simple script (best case: just using a “docker run …”
command).
2. Requirements
1. Review the provided dataset. Make sure you understand and document each field and their
relationships.
2. Provide a docker setup (image or compose) that can spin up and run a container running the
database.
3. Provide the scripts that set up the database schema for storing the data in 3NF.
4. Upload and store the data and provide us with the script(s) to do so.
5. BONUS: Automate everything in such a way that the empty database (with just the 3NF
schema) and the final populated database can be reproduced with a simple script or best case a
single command.
6. Document your work and code.
3. Expected time-frame
Time-box your work on this challenge to 3 hours max. We do not expect a perfect solution, but
are keen on learning more about how you work.
4. Deliverables
Send us your challenge submission as a link to a github/gitlab repository or a zip-file containing
all the code/data/docs. Looking forward to your submission, we thank you and wish you the best
of success!
