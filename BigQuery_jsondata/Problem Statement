Data Engineer Test
This is a small data engineering test to check your ability to work with data and prepare it for
use in analysis.
Task overview: Extract data from an API, make some transformations to it, and then load it to a
(cloud/local) relational database of your choice. Document everything so that we can replicate
your work.
Detailed steps:
1. Sign up for an API key at https://newsapi.org/
2. Use your API key to call the /everything/ method for all articles with the keyword
‘Commerzbank’.
3. Remove any articles where the source ID is empty.
4. Call the /sources/ method for all sources.
5. Load the data as two tables on a cloud analytics database (example Google BigQuery or
Amazon Redshift) or setup your own database using docker.
6. Write a simple SQL script to join the data from /everything/ with data from /sources/
Tables.
7. Setup your code to run in a docker container.
There should be no costs for you to do this if you run everything on the Google Cloud free tier
(more info here: https://cloud.google.com/free/)
What to provide:
● All scripts you use, in whatever language (although Python is preferred) including
Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
● Provide a documentation on how to run your code, including Screenshots if you are
using a UI at any stage and not scripts
