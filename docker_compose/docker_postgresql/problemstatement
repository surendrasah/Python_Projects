The list of cocktails with their required ingredients can be found here
But unfortunately, the list is not complete. It misses the instruction on how to prepare the cocktail, and what
kind of cocktail glass you need (suitable glass). Luckily, however, you have found a website/api that contains this
information, so that you could extend your list with the required information.
Both URL in programs.



## Goal
Create a solution where you load the cocktails list of your friend and enrich it with the information from thecocktaildb.
The additional information should be at least the instruction on cocktail preparation and the suitable glass. You
should save the whole information to a database, which could be later potentials used by other persons (e.g. Data
Analytics)


## CocktailDB Integration
This project involves integrating a list of cocktails provided by a friend with missing information on how to prepare the cocktail and what type of glass to serve it in. The missing information was obtained from the TheCocktailDB API and saved to a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies Used
python3

PostgreSQL

psycopg2

requests

configparser

## Installation
Install PostgreSQL by command

sudo apt-get install postgresql-12

Install required python packages by command

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## How it works

First, read database connection parameters from the database.ini file.

Next, create a new database connection by calling the connect() function.

Then, create a new cursor and execute an SQL statement to get the PostgreSQL database version.

Table is created and data are inserted. Data duplication are taken care.

After that, read the result set by calling the  fetchall() method of the cursor object.

Finally, close the communication with the database server by calling the close() method of the cursor and connection objects.

## Dump and Restore the database
To dump a PostgreSQL database in SQL format, use the pg_dump command-line tool. Here's an example command to dump a database called mydatabase:

pg_dump cocktaildb > cocktaildb.sql

To restore the database from the dump file, use the psql command-line tool:

psql cocktaildb < cocktaildb.sql


## Usage
To fetch data from the API and populate the database with cocktail information.
#### python3 cocktailparty.py


## Careful
if you git, you need to add the database.ini to the .gitignore file to not committing the sensitive information to the public repo like github. The .gitignore file will be like this: database.ini

## Assumptions and Decisions
The database schema assumes that each cocktail has a unique name.

## Future
Implement pytest to run the test suite.

Add support for more advanced search queries such as filtering by ingredients or glass type.
